Emojifi
=======

Emojifi is a Chrome extension which scans pages for emoji characters and replaces them with emoji from the EmojiOne set.  Restrictions can be placed on where the script runs to prevent emoji from webapps being overwritten or performance issues on large pages.

Installing
----------
Emojifi can be run with Google Chrome Extensions in Developer mode.  Visit chrome://extensions, tick the Developer Mode box and then load the directory as an unpackaged extension.  It will then run on the next page loaded.

Packaging
---------
If you want to package it then this can be done by pressing the pack button while to extension is loaded unpacked in Google Chrome.

Future development
------------------
This was originally designed due to Chrome not offering image emojis under Windows 8.1.  It would be good to see the ability to input emojis into Chrome without having to open up the on-screen keyboard.  Work has been started on this within the code but does not currently work.
